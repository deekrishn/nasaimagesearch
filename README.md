<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project queries the NASA Image and Video Library API and does the following:
* Accepts a search query that the user can input in the search bar.
* User clicks Go Button. And the app displays search results in a table. The table columns include NasaId, Title, Description, Date It was Created, and the link for the image itself.
* Clicking on one of the rows of the table will display a detail screen including the actual image.
